## Introduction

Large body of research interested in ideological scaling of various political groups, using various sources of data, with various methodologies

. . .

-   I contribute new data (cast vote records), a slightly new methodology (categorical IRT), and focus on an understudied group (voters)

. . .

I also show two empirical applications

1.  Representation (??)
2.  Hidden partisanship in nonpartisan elections

## Cast Vote Records

::: {layout="[10,8]"}
![](figs/pres_ballot.jpg){fig-align="left" width="543"}

-   Anonymous records of what candidate each voter picked in each race on the ballot \pause

-   1.3B "bubbles" and 40m voters in 2020 election

-   Proof of concept using Adams County, Colorado

## Item-Response Theory

```{=tex}
\begin{align*}
\onslide<1->{Y_{j, k(c)} &\sim \text{Categorical}(\pi_{j, k(c)}) \\}
\onslide<2->{\pi_{j, k(c)} &= softmax( \nu_{j, k(c)}) \\}
\onslide<3->{\nu_{j, k(c)} &= \gamma_{k(c)} \alpha_j - \beta_{k(c)}}
\end{align*}
```
| Quantity                       | Symbol           |
|--------------------------------|------------------|
| Individual                     | $j = 1, 2, …, J$ |
| Race                           | $k = 1, 2, …, K$ |
| Candidate                      | $c = 1, 2, …, C$ |
| Ideal point of voter $j$       | $\alpha$         |
| Discrimination/Slope Parameter | $\gamma$         |
| Difficulty/Location Parameter  | $\beta$          |

## Hidden Partisanship

Partisanship is embedded in who we are [@campbell_american_1960; @fiorina_retrospective_1981; @green_partisan_2002] and how political parties represent themselves [@aldrich_why_2011]

-   This extends to the state and local level, both in politics [@hopkins_increasingly_2018] and policy [@hertel-fernandez_state_2019; @grumbach_laboratories_2022]

    . . .

-   Yet, 70% of local governments use *nonpartisan* elections [@desantis_contemporary_1991; @svara2003two]

. . .

Do voters still use partisanship in the absence of party labels?

. . .

Previous work tends to use survey, aggregated observational, or small *n* individual data
