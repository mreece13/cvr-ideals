## Motivation

Partisanship is embedded in who we are [@campbell_american_1960; @fiorina_retrospective_1981; @green_partisan_2002] and how political parties represent themselves [@aldrich_why_2011]

. . .

-   This extends to the state and local level, both in politics [@hopkins_increasingly_2018] and policy [@hertel-fernandez_state_2019; @grumbach_laboratories_2022]

. . .

Yet, across the U.S., 70% of local governments use *nonpartisan* election systems where party labels are absent from the ballot [@desantis_contemporary_1991; @svara2003two]

. . .

## Question

*Do patterns in vote choice also fall along a partisan divide in the absence of party labels on the ballot?*

## Conflicting Expectations

::: incremental
1.  Progressive reformers around the turn of the 20^th^ century called for changes to insulate government from the pressure of parties and political machines [@bonneau_defense_2009; @adrian_general_1952]
    -   Local governments often perform non-ideological work, like paving roads and fixing sewers [@peterson_city_1981; @oliver2012local; @anzia_party_2021]

    -   Voter preferences on local issues don't seem to mirror preferences on national issues [@anzia_party_2021]
2.  Voters regularly rely on "heuristics," especially in low-information elections [@downs_economic_1957; @mondak_public_1993; @lau_advantages_2001]
    -   Indeed, research suggests a correlation between local public opinion, elite preferences, and policy outcomes [@tausanovitch_measuring_2013; @einstein_pushing_2016; @de_benedictis-kessner_mayoral_2016; @einstein_mayors_2018; @de_benedictis-kessner_how_2023; @sievert_nationalization_2019; @weinschenk_nationalization_2022; @kuriwaki_ticket_2023]
:::

## Data

One of the reasons there are conflicting expectations is that measurement of local preferences is extremely difficult [@anzia_party_2021]

-   Survey research is limited by sample size, question wording, survey complexity, and inaccurate reporting

-   Aggregated data must rely on strong ecological inference assumptions

. . .

I take a new approach to this problem, using ballot-level data called cast vote records (CVRs)

-   CVRs contain the true votes on all races a voter could have cast a ballot for in the election, but they only contain information on vote choice

. . .

-   I use CVRs from Adams County, Colorado

## Model Estimation

Standard 2-Parameter Item-Response Theory model [@jackman2009]

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Model

$$
\begin{align*}
Y_{j, k(c)} &\sim \text{Categorical}(\pi_{j, k(c)}) \\
\pi_{j, k(c)} &= \text{Pr}(y_{jk} = c | \alpha_j, \gamma_{k(c)}, \beta_{k(c)}) = \text{softmax}(\alpha_j \cdot \gamma_{k(c)} - \beta_{k(c)})
\end{align*}
$$

|--------------------------------|------------------|
| Individual                     | $j = 1, 2, …, J$ |
| Race                           | $k = 1, 2, …, K$ |
| Candidate                      | $c = 1, 2, …, C$ |
| Ideal point of voter $j$       | $\alpha$         |
| Discrimination/Slope Parameter | $\gamma$         |
| Difficulty/Location Parameter  | $\beta$          |

## Model Notes

Identification restrictions are essential [@jackman2009, @clinton2004, @rivers2003]

-   Normalize $\alpha$ to mean 0, standard deviation 1

-   Let $\gamma$ vacillate and post-process using the algorithm developed by @papastamoulis2022

. . .

I estimate the model under a Bayesian framework using a bespoke Stan model

## Validation – DIME Comparison

Different latent dimensions prevent me from directly comparing estimates, instead I can only compare *cutpoints*

. . .

The definition of cutpoints flows from the spatial utility model for a binary choice between $\zeta_j$ and $\psi_j$

$$
\begin{align*}
U_i\left(\zeta_j\right) &= -\left\|\xi_i-\zeta_j\right\|^2+\eta_{i j} \\
U_i\left(\psi_j \right) &=- \left\|\xi_i-\psi_j \right\|^2+v_{i j}
\end{align*}
$$

where $\xi_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is the ideal point of respondent $i$ and $\eta_{i j}$ and $v_{i j}$ are stochastic shocks

. . .

The cutpoint is then defined as $\frac{(\xi_j + \psi_j)}{2}$ , the point at which a respondent would find themselves indifferent between the two candidates

. . .

In the categorical model, I compute a series of pairwise comparisons between candidates

## Future Work

::: incremental
-   Sample more voters from more geographies, which is currently limited by computational cost
    -   Variational inference via *Pathfinder* is one option
    -   Machine learning prediction, akin to @bonica_inferring_2018, is another option
-   Model extensions
    -   Some evidence suggests that local elections are not well-described by a single dimension [@bucchianeri_party_2020]
    -   Include contests where voters could choose more than one candidate
-   Compare method directly with @lewis2001 and @reece2024
-   More than just partisanship [@anzia_party_2021]
