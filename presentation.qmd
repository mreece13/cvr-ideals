## Cast Vote Records

::: {layout="[10,8]"}
![](figs/pres_ballot.jpg){fig-align="left" width="543"}

-   Anonymous records of what candidate each voter picked in each race on the ballot \pause

-   Modelling challenges

    -   Categorical outcome with different options for each race

    -   People vote in different races \pause

-   1.3B "bubbles" and 50m voters in 2020 election

## Distribution of Cast Vote Records

## Methodology - IRT Model

```{=tex}
\begin{align*}
\onslide<1->{Y_{jk} & \sim \text{Bernoulli}(\pi_{jk}) &\text{ or } & \hfill Y_{j, k(c)} \sim \text{Categorical}(\pi_{j, k(c)}) \\}
\onslide<2->{\pi &= logit^{-1} ( \nu_{jk} ) &\text{ or } & \hfill softmax( \nu_{j, k(c)}) \\}
\onslide<3->{\nu &= \gamma_k \alpha_j - \beta_k &\text{ or } & \hfill \gamma_{k(c)} \alpha_j - \beta_{k(c)}}
\end{align*}
```
| Quantity                       | Symbol           |
|--------------------------------|------------------|
| Individual                     | $j = 1, 2, …, J$ |
| Race                           | $k = 1, 2, …, K$ |
| Candidate                      | $c = 1, 2, …, C$ |
| Ideal point of voter $j$       | $\alpha$         |
| Discrimination/Slope Parameter | $\gamma$         |
| Difficulty/Location Parameter  | $\beta$          |

## Identification and Priors

-   The scale and location of $\alpha$ are unidentified (can add or multiply a constant with no change in likelihood) \pause

    -   Set prior to $\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ and post-process draws \pause

-   $\gamma$'s sign can also flip around with relation to the sign of $\alpha$. \pause

    -   Constrain $\gamma > 0$ for Bernoulli models
    -   Post-process draws for Categorical models \pause

-   Priors

    -   Uninformative, standard priors for other parameters

    -   Future work: Informative priors using party or NOMINATE/DIME scores to help with identification and speed convergence

## Categorical Results - Ideal Points

## Categorical Results -- Aggregated Ideal Points

![](figs/cat_aggregated.jpg)

## Introduction (Option 1)

How representative is a government of its people?

<div>

-   One approach (of many) compares the "ideological" positions of legislators and voters \pause
    -   For legislators: roll-call votes [@poole_patterns_1991], campaign contributions [@bonica_mapping_2014; @bonica_inferring_2018], tweets [@barberá2015], etc. \pause
    -   For voters: surveys [e.g., @bafumi_leapfrog_2010] and **cast vote records (CVRs)** [@lewis2001] \pause
        -   I focus on CVRs because they have the most complete information and let us answer questions about down-ballot races

</div>

## Representation First Pass

![](figs/dime_comparison%20copy.jpeg)

## Introduction (Option 2)

Partisanship is embedded in who we are [@campbell_american_1960; @fiorina_retrospective_1981; @green_partisan_2002] and how political parties represent themselves [@aldrich_why_2011]

-   This extends to the state and local level, both in politics [@hopkins_increasingly_2018] and policy [@hertel-fernandez_state_2019; @grumbach_laboratories_2022]

    . . .

-   Yet, 70% of local governments use *nonpartisan* elections [@desantis_contemporary_1991; @svara2003two] where party labels are not present on the ballot

. . .

Do voters still identify and use partisanship in the absence of party labels?

## Previous Work on Hidden Partisanship

Two different ways to think about nonpartisan elections

1.  Subnational governments often perform non-ideological work [@adrian_general_1952; @peterson_city_1981; @oliver2012local; @anzia_party_2021] so voters should choose them non-ideologically

    . . .

2.  Nationalization [@hopkins_increasingly_2018], elite preferences [@tausanovitch_measuring_2013], and voter behavior [@sievert_nationalization_2019; @weinschenk_have_2021; @kuriwaki_ticket_2023] indicate that partisanship still dominates

    . . .

Research in this area tends to use surveys, aggregated observational data, or small n individual data

## Hidden Partisanship First Pass

![](figs/cat_params.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## Future Work

-   Hierarchical model to address the *representation* angle \pause

-   Scaling the models up for the full data set \pause

-   Extension to races where a voter could choose more than one candidate \pause

-   Multiple dimensions for *hidden partisanship* angle
